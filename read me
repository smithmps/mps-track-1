Viewing on a mobile and tablet

Deployment
This website was creating using WebStorm IDE, a local git directory was used for version control, and then uploaded to GitHub. I have made it live using Git pages. To do this I initiated the git repository with 'git innit', then used 'git status' to see which of my un-tracked files had not been added to the new repository. I used 'git commit -m "added in a specific message" to commit my changed files to the repository. Once my files were committed I used 'git push' to push all my new and changed files to GitHub before making it live with Git pages. I did this every time I made major changes to any part of my site.


Media
• The photos used in this site were obtained from the Southwick’s site also, and directly from the business owner and the photos he has taken.
