## First My-Profile Site
---
This site is the first assignment from the [Learning People](https://www.learningpeople.com/uk/ "Learninig People Home") Front End Developer course, track 1 assignment for HTML & CSS. 

A 'My Profile' site was to be built in accordance with HTML/CSS best practices, the fulll list of requirements are detailed below.

As I progress through the modules of the course, this site will be updated and improved.   
   

## Assignment Requirements
---
- Creation of an online portfolio, pushed ti GitHub and published via GitHub pages.
- Minimum of 3 pages/page areas including Home, About and Contact Me.
- Navigation Menu.
- Footer at the end of each page.


## Features
--- 
The site has the following key features;   
- Home Page   
logo design and profile picture using CSS formatting for size and rounded edges. Descriptions including About me, qualifications and development tools I am familiar with. The page also has links for contact via email and LinkedIn profile. A Nav bar for Home, Services and Portfolio are present on each page and the logo design links to the home page when on either Services or Portfolio pages. A footer is also displayed on each page.   

- Services Page     
An HTML list of services available based on my experience of Project Management and Front End Development. An image is also present and formatted by CSS.   

- Portfolio Page    
During the learning course, I built a basic website for a small business featuring a Home page, About page and Images page. This was an opportunity to supplement my learning and a link to that website can be found on the page. The website does not currently have an SSL certificate so it will load with an unsecure warning.
   

## Technology Used
---
This site was built using HTML5 and an external, linked CSS Style sheet. Bootstrap was not used for this site to give more exposure to style formatting with HTML ans CSS, the use of wrappers and DIV's.

At the time of writing the site does not contain the meta data to optimise UX for tablet or mobile devices. This however, will be included as part of planned improvements to the site.

## Deployment
---
This site was created using Visual Studio Code IDE, a local git directory was used for version control and then pushed to GitHub. This site is hosted using Git Pages.
